# Introduction
### WRO Future Engineers Team 

Welcome to our GitHub repository! We are ERROR 404:, a group of two young engineers: Omar and Rayane participating in the World Robot Olympiad (WRO) Future Engineers category.

Our solution aims to make a self driving car that can avoid obstacles. This repository contains all the code, schematics, and documentation for our project.

We chose to participate in the WRO because we wanted to learn and unlock a new adventure in our life . Through this project, we've learned and grown a lot as engineers and team players.

We hope you find our project interesting and inspiring. Feel free to explore our repository! 

## Engineering process

Why we chose ev3 hub: My partner and I chose the EV3 hub for our robot in the WRO Future Engineers competition because it offers a reliable and versatile platform for building and programming. The EV3 hub, also known as the EV3 Intelligent Brick, features an ARM9 300 MHz processor, 64 MB of RAM, and 16 MB of Flash memory, which can be expanded with a microSD card up to 32 GB. It has a 178x128 pixel monochrome LCD screen that provides clear interaction and feedback. With four input ports for sensors and four output ports for motors, it gives us the flexibility to design a robot that can handle a variety of tasks. Its connectivity options, including USB, mini-USB, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi (with a dongle), make it easy to communicate with our computer and other devices.

The EV3 hub can be programmed using the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 software, which features an intuitive graphical drag-and-drop interface. Additionally, it supports Scratch and Python, allowing us to use more advanced programming techniques. The hub is compatible with EV3 large and medium motors, providing both power and precision. It also supports various sensors like touch, color, ultrasonic, and gyro sensors, enabling complex interactions and autonomous behavior. Built to withstand the rigors of competition, the EV3 hub is reliable and durable. With extensive online resources, tutorials, and a large community of users and educators, we have plenty of support and inspiration. The ability to integrate with other LEGO Technic components and third-party sensors and actuators enhances its versatility, making it the perfect choice for our competition needs.


Motors: Our team chose the EV3 motors, including both the medium and large motors, because they offer a good balance of power and precision for our robot. The large motor provides the strength needed to move heavier parts and handle demanding tasks, while the medium motor is great for more precise movements and faster response times. This combination allows our robot to be both strong and agile, making it more versatile and effective in different situations. Additionally, the EV3 motors are easy to program and integrate with the rest of our EV3 system, which helps streamline our building and coding process.
